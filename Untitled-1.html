      <p>We like to say that we are not in the coffee business serving people, but in the people business serving coffee. 
       Our employees – who we call partners – are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. We are committed to making our 
       partners proud and investing in their health, well-being and success and to creating a culture of belonging where 
       everyone is welcome.</p>
