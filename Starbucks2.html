   <h1>About US:</h1>
    <h2>Overview -</h2>
   <p> WELCOME to Starbucks! Hope you will enjoy our coffee. We are famous for our nice customer service and traditional and classical
         taste of our coffee. Starbucks is an American company that operates the largest coffeehouse chain and one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the company operates more than 35,000 stores across 80 countries (as of 2022).
          Although Starbucks was not the first major coffeehouse chain in the U.S., it was the first to both popularize and mass-distribute
          a particular brand of café culture. Starting in the 1990s, Starbucks began promoting coffee as a holistic experience that 
          combined ambiance, community, function, and lifestyle. By transforming people’s perception of coffee and coffeehouses, Starbucks
           achieved outsize growth and established itself as one of the most dominant names in the coffeehouse industry.</p>

           <h2>Our Heritage-</h2>
           <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here where Starbucks opened its
             first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was
              inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

            Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become captivated with Starbucks coffee
             from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. It was on
              a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth
               and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next
                chapter as a coffeehouse.
            
            Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996,
             we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two 
             decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of 
             neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: With every cup, with 
             every conversation, with every community - we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection.</p>
